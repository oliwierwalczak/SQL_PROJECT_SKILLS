# Introduction
Hello, my name is Oliwier Walczak and this is my very first project on GitHub connected with the business area I am interested into, which is data analytics\science.

At first, I want to thank to Luke Barrouse, data analyst and content creator, who have prepared all materials, including raw data and videos where he shows step by step how to prepare such professional project. All my work here was based on materials and methods proposed by Mr. Barrouse.
